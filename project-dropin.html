		<div class="description-text">
		  <p>At Braintree, I was tasked with leading the ground up redesign of a legacy product called Drop In. Drop In was a widely used product for developers to create simple PCI compliant credit card forms that blended into their own checkout forms.</p>

		  <p>The previous release of the product was using a quite opinionated design that wasn't generic enough to fit into any merchant's existing page. There was also very limited availability and layout for different payment methods. The initial research determined whether we should even keep the product, and how it should fit into the existing product ecosystem.</p>

		  <p>The entire redesign process took about 2 years to complete, from the initial research to launch. There was quite a bit of refinement and user research via UsabilityHub, Userresearch.com, and the PayPal usability lab. A mobile version also needed to be designed and developed, and the assets, which would be globally served, needed to be pixel perfected. The design of the checkout form needed to scale so new payment methods like ApplePay and GooglePay could be infinitely added. I even had to jump in to some CSS to make it IE9 compatible.</p>

		  <p>In the end, all the research and work paid off, the product launched in 2018 and I just used it the other day (in 2025) to buy some Girl Scout Cookies!</p>
