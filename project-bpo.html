		<h2 class="project-title">BPO Manager</h2>
		<div class="description-text">
			<p>At Assembled, we created software for scheduling customer service representatives. Not simple by any means, there's quite a bit of complexity involved in scheduling, particularly on forecasting volume and making sure you have the right amount of service coverage, not too few people, but also not too many, major drivers of workforce management.</p>

			<p>I was pulled in as the lead designer onto the design and launch of a new product in collaboration with our client, Stripe. Stripe, as many clients did, used BPOs (Business Process Outsourcing) to handle a significant amount of their customer service caseload. These BPOs are essentially third-party vendors that handle customer service for you. These vendors need to work in conjunction with any in-house teams and also, your staffing needs to be accurate not only on your in-house teams, but also on the variety of vendors you might be using.</p>

			<p>This project required frequent dialogs with Stripe to understand their needs, it also was a new frontier for workforce management as no competitors had released anything that could manage external vendor staffing. The problems in this product were complex and challenging, from encountering limitations in our own product to the constant requirement refinement.</p>

			<p>The BPO manager launched to GA with both Stripe and Robinhood fully onboarded and several other customers lined up. It also launched a new era of Vendor Management at Assembled, growing the product well beyond the scheduling functionality, and was a key selling point for pulling in even larger clients to work with like Salesforce.</p>
