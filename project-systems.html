	  <div class="description-text">
		<p>I've worked with a range of design systems in various states over the years. Most recently, I worked extensively on Assembled's design system, called Assemblage. I served as Chief Button Officer, and collaborated with other designers to push forward our design system, which, when I first joined, consisted of a single page of inconsistent components.</p>

		<p>I saw through many major changes of the design system, from changing the legacy primary colors to ones that made more sense with the brand (never an easy task when something has legacy CSS running around it), to redefining the type system and supporting variable fonts. With another designer and a UX developer, we worked through trimming down our background colors and making a system that worked in both light and dark mode, eventually creating tokens in Figma to accommodate the different modes and allow designers to use components that just worked in either mode.</p>

		<p>Through all this, there was component building and refinement, as Figma rolled out new features for components, I adapted many of them to give us better tooling. Some of the components became quite complex in their flexibility. There was constant discussion and pairing on testing new components, and I worked closely with the entire team at various points.</p>

		<p>So much design is discussion based, and though I left Assembled with a fairly robust design system in place, the conversations always informed the development of the system. I had learned that early on when I took up the mantle of implementing Braintree's first design system, which really was, just a meeting. Ages ago, I wrote an essay about the messiness of design systems, feel free to check it out!</p>
